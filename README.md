# eur-usd_price_prediction
This project focuses on predicting the high and low prices of the EUR/USD currency pair for a specific day.
How It Works:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Reads historical forex data.
Cleans, scales, and prepares data for modeling.
Feature Engineering:

Extracts relevant features such as historical trends, indicators, and other market factors.
Model Training:

Implements machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest or others) for predicting the target variables: today_high and today_low.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
Visualizes predictions compared to actual values.
Prediction:

Uses the trained model to predict the high and low prices for a specific day.
Visualization:

Provides plots and graphs to analyze the predictions and data trends.
Usage:

Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible platform.
Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess data, train the model, and generate predictions.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and other dependencies mentioned in the notebook.
Output:

Predicted high and low prices for EUR/USD.
Visualizations of model predictions versus actual values.
Applications:

Real-world forex trading and market analysis.
Predicting price movements for risk management and decision-making.
